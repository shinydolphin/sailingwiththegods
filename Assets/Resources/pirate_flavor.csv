Based on the look of the pirates and their ship, {0} recognizes the pirates! They are {1}, from a region he knows.@Thucydides wrote of the Aetolians that in their country, everyone still followed old piratical habits: 'For in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and islands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to turn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. They would fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere collection of villages, and would plunder it. Indeed, this came to be the main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement, but even some glory.'%(Thucydides 1.5.1-1.6.1)@These brigands fight for their own profit and the glory of their country's ruler, Queen Teutal. For Illyrians, piracy was a state industry. She famously told Rome: 'So far as concerned private activities it was not customary for Illyrian rulers to preclude their subjects from augmenting their fortunes at sea'%(Polybius 2.8)@King Minos of Crete was rumored to have cleared the sea of piracy, and so improved his own profits (Thucydides 1.4); Crete itself was a famous pirate's nest. Odysseus pretended to be one of these ferocious men: 'Farming I never cared for, nor life at home, nor fathering fair children. I reveled in long ships with oars; I loved polished lances, arrows in the skirmish, the shapes of doom that others shake to see. Carnage suited me: heaven put those things in me somehow. Each to his own pleasure! Before we young Achaians shipped for Troy I led men on nine cruises in ships to raid strange coasts, and had great luck, taking rich spoils on the spot, and even more in the division. So my house grew prosperous, my standing therefore high among the Cretans.'%(<i>Odyssey</i> 14.222-34)@Etruscan pirates were so bold that they dared to kidnap Dionysus himself! 'I will tell of Dionysus, the son of glorious Semele, how he appeared on a jutting headland by the shore of the fruitless sea, seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood: his rich, dark hair was waving about him, and on his strong shoulders he wore a purple robe. Presently there came swiftly over the sparkling sea Tyrsenian pirates on a well-decked ship - a miserable doom led them on. When they saw him they made signs to one another and sprang out quickly, and seizing him straightaway put him on board their ship exultingly; for they thought him the son of heaven-nurtured kings. They sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he sat with a smile in his dark eyes.%(Homeric Hymn to Dionysus 1-14)@@@@@@@
A speedy ship appears on the horizon, and we hear the sounds of arms rattling and male voices yelling instructions. These are pirates, who grow rich through violent conquest of seagoing ships and innocent port towns! They come from many places - Illyria, Crete, Aetolia, Etruria - and range far and wide; all of them are fearsome, and all are (unfortunately) worthy competitors.@Like tribes of swarming flies. Some of them did Ares, bane of men, hungry for the war-cry, take in open fight, others cast he over the crags. Let us, then, go forward behind our hollow shields like a flight of locusts…. In a moment one and all together shall we be wielding the flail, standing up to the spearmen; and dire will be the din when both sides clash rounded shield against rounded shield, and awful the shrieks as they fall one upon another, piercing men's breasts with the spear; and no whit will they draw back for the pounding of the missiles, nay, despite the battery of great hurlstones, the helms shall abide the rattle of war unbowed.%(Tyrtaeus 1.2.2, 7th c BC)@As a fire burns through a boundless forest%On the mountain crests, and from far off the glare can be seen:%Just so does the gleam from the polished bronze of armor%Flash through the whole sky, up to the very heavens%(<i>Iliad</i> 1.438-441)@Just as great hordes of flies keep swarming around%A sheepfold in spring, when milk overflows the buckets%In such numbers do the pirates board the hapless vessel%(Adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 2.453-4)@They advance with a raucous shouting, like cranes%Whose shrieks fill the sky as they flee from the storms of winter%And the endless rain, and fly toward the river Ocean,%Bringing swift death through the air to the pygmy troops%(<i>Iliad</i> 3.2-5)@@@@@@@
Pirates are always open to negotiation! You can convince them with money, promises of alliance, flattery, insults, or tricks. As you negotiate, the pirate crew begins to shout insults your way.@<i>Desmota!</i> (Convict!)@<i>Katadike!</i> (Crow bait!)@<i>Miarotate!</i> (O most defiled!)@<i>Kakiste!</i> (You're the worst!)@<i>Kouphologos!</i> (Fatuous babbler!)@<i>Rhipsapsis!</i> (Shield thrower!)@<i>Hierosulos!</i> (Temple robber!)@<i>Pharmakos!</i> (You filthy little bundle of ritual offscourings!)@You are a slave from a long line of slaves, a lecher and a lascivious man!%(Achilles Tatius, <i>The Adventures of Leukippe and Kleitophon</i>)@You eater of leftovers!%(<i>Odyssey</i> 17.219-20)@A towering captain with the spraddly length of leg… who swaggers in his lovelocks and cleanshaves beneath the chin!'%(Archilochus fr. 7, 7th c BC)
You escaped! Your gloriously tanned, vaguely heroic body is breathing, but your reputation just took a deep dive!@You run away like a dog who has just stolen a sausage!%(Aristophanes, <i>Acharnians</i>)@You coward!! Just as a man sees a snake in some mountain valley and jumps back with trembling legs and cheeks drained of color: just so do you shrink away!%(Adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 2.29-31)@Some champion you are! Just a pretty face, a man without any strength, without any courage!%(<i>Iliad</i> 3.39-40)@You're a miserable disgrace, and excruciatingly handsome, woman-crazed, seducer, selfish fool!%(<i>Iliad</i> 3.33-34)@@@@@@@
Achilles had swift knees, but you do not!

Glory is yours! Bravery in battle, a sharp aim with a sword, the clamour of praise all accompany your deeds. You beat them!@Straightaway the red blood ran forth from his mouth, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and he gnashed his teeth, kicking the ground with his feet…. And those who watched raised their hands, and were like to die with laughter.%(Adapted from <i>Odyssey</i> 18.90)@Strife is good for mortals!%(Hesiod, <i>Works and Days</i> 24)@Give no ground, and if you beat them, do not brag in open show, nor, if they beat you, run home and lie down on your bed and cry!%(Archilochus fr. 9, 7th c BC)@It is a high thing, a bright honor, for a man to do battle!%(Callinus of Ephesos, 7th c BC)@The eyes of all the people gaze on the high-hearted warrior as if he stood like a bastion before them. His actions are like an army's, though he is only one man!%(Adapted from Callinus of Ephesos, 7th c BC)@@@@@@
You have lost! Valiant as you may have imagined yourself to be, the pirates have bested you. Prepare for a new life - poorer, less stable, and far more embarrassing.@Just as great hordes of flies keep swarming around a sheepfold in spring, when milk overflows the buckets: In such numbers do the pirates board the hapless vessel%(Adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 2.453-4)@Here beside us stand the black Death-Spirits… the harvest of youth is as quickly come as the rising Sun spreads his light abroad.%(CURFRAG.tlg-0255.2)@We who are human have no minds, but live, from day to day, like beasts and nothing know of what God plans to make happen to each of us.%(Semonides of Amorgos, fr. 2, 7th c BC)@My child, Zeus the deep-thundering holds the ends of all actions in his hands, disposes as he will of everything.%(Semonides of Amorgos, fr. 2, 7th c BC)@Some men, battered in the sudden hurricane on the sea, where waves crowd big across the blue salt water, drown and die, when all they looked for was some way to live.%(Semonides of Amorgos, fr. 2, 7th c BC)@In their thousands stand bad spirits, and innumerable griefs, and pains about our life%(Semonides of Amorgos, fr. 2, 7th c BC)@If men would take advice from me, we should not long for what is really bad, nor buy our heart's own torment for our hard work done in vain.%(Semonides of Amorgos, fr. 2, 7th c BC)@The time of after death for us is very long%We live a wretched sum of years, and badly, too%(Semonides of Amorgos, fr. 3, 7th c BC)@@@
