Who else (leftbrace)than Palamedes(rightbrace) could have made human life resourceful from resourceless and ornamented from unadorned, by inventing military tactics as the greatest defense against acts of overreaching, and written laws as guardians of justice, and writing as an instrument of memory, and weights and measures as reconciliations of commercial exchanges, and number as the guardian of property, and fire signals as the strongest and swiftest messengers, and pessoi as a painless pastime for leisure?%(fr. B 11a.30 Diels-Krantz)@flavor
Did this man (leftbrace)Palamedes(rightbrace) not drive away the famine from those men, so to speak with god's grace, and did he not invent the cleverest pastimes for those sitting at ease after the stroke of battle - pessoi and kuboi as a pleasant cure of idleness?%(Sophocles, <i>Palamedes</i> F. 479)@flavor
The board is called the 'city' and each piece is called a 'dog'; the pieces are of two colors, and the art of the game consists in taking a piece of one color by enclosing it between two of the other color.%(<i>Onomasticon</i> 9.97-98)@flavor
no idle game, but one full of wisdom and needing great attention%(Philostratus, <i>Heroikos</i> 33.4)@flavor
(leftbrace)Socrates' victims are(rightbrace) bad Petteia players, who are finally cornered and made unable to move by clever ones.%(Plato, <i>Republic</i> 6.487b)@flavor

he who is without city through nature rather than chance is either a mean sort or superior to man; he is without clan, without hearth... the one who is such by nature has by this fact a desire for war, as if he were an isolated piece in a game of petteia.%(Aristotle, <i>Pol.</i> 1.2.10, 1253a7)@flavor
When you are weary with the weight of your studies, if perhaps you are pleased not to be inactive but to start games of skill, in a more clever way you vary the moves of your counters on the open board, and wars are fought out by a soldiery of glass, so that at one time a white counter traps blacks, and at another a black traps whites.%(<i>Laus Pisonis</i> 190-194)@flavor
What counter has not fled from you? What counter gave way when you were its leader? What counter of yours, though doomed to die, has not destroyed its foe? Your battle line joins combat in a thousand ways: that counter, flying from a pursuer, itself makes a capture; another, which stood at a vantage point, corners from a position far retired; this one dares to trust itself to the struggle, and deceives an enemy advancing on its prey; that one risks dangerous traps, and, apparently entrapped itself, counter traps two opponents; this one is advanced to greater things, so that when the formation is broken, it may quickly burst into the columns, and so that, when the rampart is overthrown, it may devastate the closed walls. Meanwhile, however keenly the battle rages with cut-up soldiers, you conquer with a formation that is full, or bereft of only a few soldiers, and each of your hands rattles with its band of captives.%(<i>Laus Pisonis</i> 195-208)@flavor
Let her carefully, not recklessly, play the battle of the brigands, when a single piece falls before its two-fold enemy, and the warrior caught solo fights on, and the enemy retraces multiple times the trek he has begun.%(Ovid, <i>The Art of Love/Ars Amatoria</i> 3.358)@flavor
...how the soldier sneaks up to attack, taking the straight path when his piece between two enemies is lost, and how he understands the chase in the thick of war, and how to bring back the man before him and to retreat in safety - not without a retainer!%(Ovid, <i>Tristia</i> 2.478)@flavor
And then she found the lordly suitors. They were then rejoicing their spirit with pessoi%in front of the doors, sitting on the skins of cattle, which they themselves had killed. And%their heralds and nimble servants - some were mixing wine and water in kraters, others%in tun were cleaning the tables with sponges full of holes and setting them out, still%others were dividing up many pieces of meat.%(Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> 1.106-112)@flavor
The suitors numbered one hundred and eight, and divided the counters between opposing sides, ...so that there were fifty-four on a side. A small space was left between them, and in this middle space they set one counter which they called Penelope; this they made the mark to be thrown at with another counter. Then they drew lots, and the one who drew first took aim. If a player succeeded in pushing Penelope forward, he moved his piece to the position occupied by her before being hit and thrust out, then again setting up Penelope he would try to hit her with his own piece from the second position which he occupied. If he hit her without touching any other player's piece, he won the game and had high hopes of marrying her. Eurymachus had won the greatest number of victories in this game, and looked forward to his marriage with confidence.%(Athenaeus, <i>Deipnosophistae</i> 1.16f-17)@flavor
Because of their easy life (leftbrace)playing Petteia(rightbrace), the suitors' arms were so flabby that they could not even begin to stretch the bow.%(Athenaeus, <i>Deipnosophistae</i> 1.17b)@flavor
