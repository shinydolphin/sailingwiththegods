myth@Doris@Tell me of this place, Doris. @In the name of this city lies the Dorian race - those who think 'Doris' means 'woodland' or 'upland', appropriate for its mountain slopes! Dorians are the children of Herakles, who drove away the Dryopes from this site to claim it as their own: you may call them 'hunger Dorians', since they took such rich farmland! The soil is deep, the water abundant, springing from the Kephissos river; three mountain ranges protect her round about. Those Dryopes were brigands, pirates of the dry land: from there they ranged far and wide%.(Skylax 62)
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@This island has had many names! Some used to call it 'big' (Makris), others 'Long' (Doliche), - others Abantis, for the warrior tribes who lived here (Iliad 2.540-541, 'the raging Abantes who held Euboia and Chalcis and Eretria and Histiaia with its fine vineyards, and Kerinthos on the sea'.) Now we call it 'The land of the well-fed oxen', Euboia.
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@After rounding Sounion from Attike the island Euboia lies ahead, previously called, they say, Makris ('long') from its nature, next from the so-called Asopis, taking with time again the name Euboia. The first to inhabit it, they say, were mixed Lelegian settlers; Pandoros the son of Erechtheos crossed over from Attike to found Chalkis, the largest city on it, and Aiklos, an Athenian by race, founded Eretria, and likewise Kothos founded Kerinthos on the shore; Dryopes founded the city named Karystos, while Hestiaia was a foundation of the Perrhaibians. Islands lie near it, Skyros, Peparethos, Skiathos; the Cretans who crossed over from Knossos with Staphylos once settled Peparethos and Ikos, the island lying near it, while legend says Pelasgians crossed over from Thrace to settle Skyros and Skiathos. The Chalcidians resettled all of them after they became deserted.%(Geographi Graeci Minores 566)
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@This place may only be an island because of the hand of Poseidon: earthquakes shook it, long ago, and it may have been these that separated it from the mainland Greeks.%(Thucydides, Strabo)
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@It is the first place the Greeks, sailing to Troy, found themselves stalled! At Euboia, near Chalcis, Agamemnon and his men were held in place when the winds were denied them, due to the king's arrogance and his offense to Artemis.
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboians are famous traders! Their weights and measures are used for trade throughout Asia Minor.
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@The nymph of the island is as famous as the island is grand in size and reputation. Euboea was the nymph of the fountain, daughter of the river god Asopos. She stole the heart of the sea-god Poseidon; he stole her from her father, brought her to the island, and made it her home forever.%(Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1; Corinna Fr. 654) 
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Poseidon is worshipped here ... and in the cities the Euboians founded! He is honored at Mende, as shaker of the earth and god of the sea; in Zankle in the far west, the god's own son Orion set up his father's sanctuary; on Euboea itself Orion has a cult. And in Aigai on Euboia, Poseidon has a shrine (Hesiod Fr. 149 MW; Diodorus Siculus 4.85; Strabo 9; Pausanias 9.20.3).
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@"Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Of him Hesiod wrote: ""Three other sons, Hekatoncheires were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and doughty beyond telling, Kottos and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children. From their shoulders sprang a hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms."""
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Hesiod tells his story: 'But the glorious allies of loud-crashing Zeus, the Hekatonkheires, have their dwelling upon Okeanos' foundations, namely Kottos and Gyes; but Briareos, being goodly, the deep-roaring Earth-Shaker Poseidon made his son-in-law, giving him Kymopoliea ('Wave-Roaming') his daughter to wed.'
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Plato claimed, 'If a man were gifted by nature with the frame of a Geryon or a Briareus, with his hundred hands, he ought to be able to throw a hundred darts.'%(Laws 795c)
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Virgil reports: 'Many monstrous forms besides of various beasts are stalled at the doors of Hades, Centaurs and double-shaped Scyllae, and the hundredfold Briareus, and the beast of Lerna the Hydra, hissing horribly, and the Chimaera armed with flame, Gorgons and Harpies and the shape of the three-bodied shade Geryon.'%(Aeneid 6.287-90)
myth@Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Aelian cites Aristotle, saying that 'before the pillars of Herakles were so called they were known as the pillars of Briareos. But when Herakles purified both land and sea and became indisputably the benefactor of mankind, men honored him, named the pillars after Herakles and ceased to honor the memory of Briareos.'%(Historical Miscellany 5.3)
myth@Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Some think it has its name because Orion was raised here, that handsome giant and hunter! He followed in the company of Artemis on Crete (Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.3; Hyginus Poeticon Astronomicon 2.34); some say she loved him, and Apollo tricked her into shooting him as he swam in the sea. Or it may be that he loved her against her will, so she sent him a monster of a scorpion to kill him (Horace Carmina 2.4.72; Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.5). It lies at the foot of the mountain Telethrius, on the river Callas, on a high rock.%(Strabo 10.1.4)
myth@Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Artemis Proseoa is celebrated here - 'Artemis who faces the East' - this is where the navy of the Greeks anchored in 480 for three days, as they fought off the fleet of Persian Xerxes, who here sought critical access to the gulf. Plutarch reports that the temple was surrounded by a wall made of marble that gave off the scent and color of saffron when rubbed.%(Themistokles 8.1)
myth@Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@This is a land rich in vines, ruled once upon a time by the ferocious Abantes: 'the raging Abantes who held Euboia and Chalcis and Eretria and Histiaia with its fine vineyards, and Kerinthos on the sea' (<i>Iliad</i> 2.540-541). Those Abantes descended from Ares, and were generous of spirit; they wore their hair long in battle, tying it at their backs and shearing it at the front, a haircut called the 'Theseis' for the great Theseus.%(Plutarch, <i>Theseus</i> 5.1; Homer, <i>Iliad</i> 2.540-550)
myth@Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@The territory of this town once covered the entire northern half of Euboia, the great island
myth@Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Former enemies, settlers and rulers are now among its network of friends! They are now aligned with Athens, but long ago they were part of an uprising against that city, and even murdered the crew of one of her ships. Because of this the Athenians sent 2000 settlers to Histiaia's shores (Livy 28.6.2; 31.46.9). Later it was part of the Athenian league (Livy 28.5.18), then ruled by Macedon.

myth@Iolcus@Do you know the myths of my homeland?@The town itself is 'rich in grapes' (Deipnosophistae 4.172), and well cultivated (Orphic Argonautica 1369).
myth@Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@There are minerals here famous for their properties. Theophrasuts wrote, 'There appears to be a kind of earth in some places, which when sprinkled over the seed helps to make wheat keep, for instance, the earth found at Olynthos and at Kerinthos in Euboea; this makes the grain inferior for food, but fuller in appearance; the earth is sprinkled in the proportion of one pint to twenty-four of grain.'%(<i>Enquiry into Plants</i> 8.11.6)
myth@Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@This is a small town (Strabo 10.446), near the banks of the river Budorus: Kothos of Athens was her founder, and she was sufficiently tied into the world of Greek cities to send ship to Ilium to fight against the Trojans!%(<i>Iliad</i> 2.538; Pliny, <i>Natural History</i> 4.12.21).

myth@Narthakion@What can you tell me of this place?@They were long in a dispute with Meliteia, one of their neighbors in Thessaly.
myth@Opus@When I come to from that town, what tales will I hear?@They may sit you down and regale you with tales of the son of Zeus named Opus, born to him by Protogeneia, the daughter of Deucalion; their town is one of the first of Greece! (Pindar Olympian 9) It sent ships to the war at Troy, led by Ajax the Lesser, son of Oilesus the Locrian king; here at Opus are games in honor of their hero, the Aiantea, and an altar honoring his memory.
myth@Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@The centaur Chiron himself compounded herbs gathered on the hills of Pagasae, with which he tended wounds.%(Ovid, <i>Fasti</i> 5.379)
myth@Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Some people believe that the place has its name from the construction of your ship, the Argo! (Hyginus Astronomica 2.37.1) And I have heard the legend that the ship refused to sail out onto the unknown waters, to places she had never known, until 'the sea, summoned by the lyre, obeyed the music and came up to the stern of the sacred bark'.%(Silius Italicus, <i>Punica</i> 11.449). 
myth@Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Now some folks argue (and I think they are right) that the place comes from the name of its foundations, many in number and abundant in their waters (Strabo 9.5.15) Indeed it's famous for its hot springs! (Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i> 12.37, 31.39.1)
myth@Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Well they're famous for selling slaves, 'and branded rascals at that'.%(Athenaeus, <i>Deipnosophistae</i> 1.27) 
myth@Pelion@The mountain is the source for the wood of my ship! Poets to come will sing of that fact: 'Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion floated through Neptune's clear waves, to the River Phasis and Aeetes' (Catullus 64.1). And it is great in size: Dicaearchus, a savant of the first rank, with the support of royal patrons took the measurement of mountains, and published that the highest of them was Pelion, with an altitude of 1250 paces (Pliny the Elder, Natural History 1-11, 2.65.1) I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Wise old Herodotus tells us the tale of the shipwreck of the Persian fleet - and the mountain's role in it! 'When the darkness had come on, although the season was the middle of summer, yet there came on very abundant rain, which lasted through the whole of the night, with crashing thunder from Mount Pelion; and the dead bodies and pieces of wreck were cast up at Aphetai and became entangled round the prows of the ships and struck against the blades of the oars: and the men of the army who were there, hearing these things became afraid, expecting that they would certainly perish, to such troubles had they come; for before they had had even breathing space after the shipwreck and the storm which had arisen off Mount Pelion, there had come upon them a hard sea-fight, and after the sea-fight a violent storm of rain and strong streams rushing to the sea and crashing thunder'.%(Histories 8.12)
myth@Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@It is the source of medicinal herbs: the type that thrive in cold regions, as centaury and wormwood, and further those that have medicinal properties in their roots and juices, such as hellebore, squirting cucumber, scammony, and nearly all those whose roots are gathered. Some which grow on Pelion are found as well in Pontus and Thrace, some about Oeta, Parnassus, Ossa and Telethrion, and in these parts some say that there is great abundance.%(Theophrastus, <i>Enquiry into Plants</i> 4.5.1-2) 
myth@Pelion@Worthy details, but are there not myths to share?@It is an infamous place, for infamous deeds of the immortals themselves! Otos and Ephialtes, whose names mean 'insatiate' and '˜nightmare', were the sons of Iphimede, wife of Aloeos, whom she bore to Poseidon. They were of extraordinary size - they each grew nine inches every month, and so when they were nine years old, they tried to climb into heaven. They began this way: they placed Mount Ossa on Pelion (from this Mount Ossa is also called Pelion), and were piling up other mountains. But they were discovered by Apollo and killed. ...When they wished to assault Artemis, she could not resist their strength, and Apollo sent a deer between them. Driven mad by anger in trying to kill it with javelins, they killed each other. In the Land of the Dead they are said to suffer this punishment: they are bound by serpents to a column, back to back. Between them is a screech-owl, sitting on the column to which they are bound'.%(Hyginus, <i>Fabulae</i> 28)
myth@Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Virgil sings of it: 'Three times, indeed, they tried to pile Ossa on Pelion, and roll wooded Olympus on top of Ossa: three times Zeus split the mountain pile apart with his lightning bolt.'%(Georgics 1.259)

myth@Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Here Aloeus' sons Gigantic rose against the gods, what time Pelion had almost touched the stars supreme, And Ossa's loftier peak amid the sky Opposing, barred the constellations' way'%(Lucan, <i>Pharsalia</i> 6.480)
myth@Pelion@And what will I find there?@Crags of the mountain tower above this port; north of it lies the Tomb of Dolops. The mountain's slopes can drive storms and thunder into the sea.%(Herodotus 812)
myth@Pelion@What can you tell me of the land of Pelion?@You must know that it is the land of centaurs - the race descended from Ixion, who assaulted Hera - or thought he did! It was a cloud he attacked, not the goddess herself, but the cloud bore him a child - a monstrous offspring - there was never a mother or a son like this - honored neither by men nor by the laws of the gods. She raised him and named him Centaurus, and he mated with the Magnesian mares in the foothills of Pelion, and from them was born a marvelous horde, which resembled both its parents: like the mother below, the father above. The gods accomplish everything according to their wishes.%(Pindar, <i>Pythian</i> 2.25)
myth@Pelion@Chiron the centaur, my old tutor and friend, indeed dwells there - he raised me there as he tended 'the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, pre-eminent among men, on woody Pelion, for he was still a boy.'%(Hesiod F 68-89).@Chiron had a magical lyre that could stir up the storms of the sea: 'A third lyre, whose strains moulded the minds of heroes and the spirit of great Achilles in the cave of Mount Pelion - the lyre that Chiron loved, could quell the raging sea or the wrath of Hell itself, when he struck the strings.'%(SIlius Italicus, <i>Punica</i> 11.449) 
myth@Pherae@Is the place known among the poets - have great deeds happened here?@This is the land of King Admetus, who's famous for shame rather than bravery! He let his own wife take his place in Hades when it was time for him to die. The women of the land mourned her loss: 'Cry out, Oh, lament. O land of Pherae, For the best of women Fades away in her doom Under the earth, To dark Hades' (Euripides Alcestis 201). But Herakles the great, the son of Zeus, recovered her from Hades. 
myth@Phthia@What tales can you tell me of this place?@As Homer says in his Iliad: 'But now, seeing I am not minded to battle with goodly Hector, tomorrow will I do sacrifice to Zeus and all the gods, and heap well my ships, when I have launched them on the sea; then shalt thou see, if so be thou wilt, and carest aught therefor, my ships at early dawn sailing over the teeming Hellespont, and on board men right eager to ply the oar; and if so be the great Shaker of the Earth grants me fair voyaging, on the third day shall I reach deep-soiled Phthia'.%(Homer, <i>Iliad</i> 9.346 - ca. 700 BCE )

myth@Phthia@What tales can you tell me of this place?@And here I dwell upon the boundaries of Phthia and Pharsalia's town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of Thessaly call it the Thetideion, in honour of the goddess's marriage.%(Euripides, <i>Andromache</i> 1 - ca. 425 BCE )
myth@Phylace@What tales can you tell me of this place?@A sanctuary to the hero can be found in the city (Pindar Isthmian 1.83); here they honor him with games! His cult and myth continued even after the city became part of Thebae Phthiotides.
myth@Skiathos@Are there stories to tell of this island town?@Its history is bigger than its shoreline! At this place three ships of the Greeks - one from Troizen, one from Aegina, and one from Athens - waited and watched while the Persian fleet of Xerxes approached.%(Herodotus 7.179)
myth@Skiathos@Are there stories to tell of this island town?@A temple of Artemis watches over the passage between Skiathos and the mainland: it commemorates the destruction of the Persian fleet off the Euboian coast. She is a goddess who can control the sea! You know the tale of how she demanded the blood of Iphigeneia before she let the Greeks sail to Troy: she locked up the winds and the favorable currents till they gave what she demanded.

pirate@Doris@Will I keep my eye on the horizon for pirate vessels if I choose to trek to Anthedon?@You will if you wish to live! Scoundrelly Illyrians who take pride in their piracy, Aetolians famous in war, and the Etruscans who swoop in from western shores, will all be keeping an eye out for travelers like you.
pirate@Euboia@Must my crew keep arms at the ready as we cruise along its banks?@You will if you hope to survive! Many pirates know its coves: Illyrians who follow Queen Teuta, Cretan dogs, the rascally grandsons of Minos, and Aetolians who'll sack a sanctuary to pluck out a gold statue or two!
pirate@Histiaia/Oreos@Do the people of Histiaia have reason to fear when they put to sea - do pirates lurk along their coasts?@Alas indeed! They tremble for the Aetolian pirates, as well as Illyrian: both types as greedy as they are fearless! Homer sang of this ferocity: 'Even as a leopard goes forth from a deep thicket in full view of a hunter and he is not afraid, He does not flee when he hears the baying of the hounds.'%(<i>Iliad</i> 21.568-570)
pirate@Iolcus@What of pirates in my homeland?@Indeed! Iolcus is beset by Illyrians and Aetolians alike: Ferocious pirates, they will be the end of you! The eels and the fishes will finish you off, dining on the fat from your kidneys while the dark water laps about you.%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.201-205)
pirate@Kerinthos@Will pirates lurk around the bend as we draw close to this town?@Illyrians, Cretans and Aetolians alike hover to challenge you, and grow rich from your stores! They will fall upon you and you will strive to escape: as when, beneath the surge of a fire, locusts take wing to flee to a river as the relentless fire sears them with its sudden oncoming, and they shrink down beneath the water.%(<i>Iliad</i> 21.12-15)
pirate@Kerinthos@Will pirates lurk around the bend as we draw close to this town?@Indeed - Cretans famous for lying, Aetolians famous for bravery, and Illyrians, famous for love of piratical craft!

pirate@Pagasae@Must I fear pirates in these waters, and keep an eye on my crew, my stores, my life?@Only if you are wise! The port from which you first set sail is on the itinerary as well for pirates from Aetolia and Illyria: how unfortunate it never chose to become the friends of the Aetolians!  Such pirates are mighty in battle: they will cast you to the fishes, to lick the blood from your wounds! Nor will your mothers get to mourn you, but your remains will dance along the surface of the broad breast of the sea - many a fish, leaping amid the waves, will dart up from the black ruffling water to eat your white fat.%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.124-130)
pirate@Pelion@Do pirates lurk in this region?@Indeed, even in the shadow of the mountain of centaurs! It seems the memory of the centaurs infuses the people who sail its coasts: pirates of Crete and Aetolia, Illyrians as well, come close by, sniffing the air for a ready catch! 'Their bronze swords will loosen your knees and undo your strong heart, Your dark blood will flow from your neck and wet the ground'!%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.116-121)
pirate@Pherae@Must I keep an eye on my back, watching for pirates off its shores?@You have heard of the Illyrians, followers of a queen who puts Amazons to shame, the Aetolians who fear no man and love all gain - they will embrace you at your coming, undo the strings of your purse, and leave your men shaking in their rowing benches! Prepare for a fight if you draw into those waters!

pirate@Skiathos@Do pirates know the island, and its bays? Must I keep an eagle eye out for what I say in the taverns there, lest they overhear my plans?@They know it, and compete with each other to pluck the unwary, like fish from the fisherman's nets! The Illyrians, grandsons of Snake-like Kadmos and Harmonia, whom he plucked from Samothrace's festivals, will haunt your trails; Cretans, who can credit great Minos for their habit of lying, will vie to outdo them. And Aetolians, who never fear a fight, may outdo those two in boarding your ship and seizing your wares.
pirate@Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight!

network@Alope@How well connected are the people of Alope? Are many Greeks in their networks of friends?@It's not for its network that you would put in! You'd sooner find a river nymph on a Cycladic rock than a network associate of that little town - they have none at all.
network@Anthedon@Friendly or insular, open or closed, what will I encounter as the networks of this town?@They are in the network of Aetolians. They extend from one end of the world to the other! Kyzikos rich in gold staters, Syracuse with her green fields and fine temples, the islands of Crete and Sicily, Thracians skilled in trade and iron, and the Phoenicians of noble Sidon... all the way into the Black Sea.
network@Doris@Will the city care for the networks that hold bind cities together?@Not a whit! They neither give proxenia, nor honor the bonds of other cities.

network@Histiaia/Oreos@How networked to friends across the sea are the people of Histiaia?@Clever and foresightful are the people of this town! They are among the network of the Aitolians, masters of weaving connections from Sidon to the far west, as well as the people of Epidauros of Argos. Folks would flock to Epidauros to be healed by Asclepius himself - it is a sanctuary worth seeing! And the town had ties across the Peloponnese.
network@Histiaia/Oreos@How networked to friends across the sea are the people of Histiaia?@The proxenoi of this city stretch from one side of the sea to another!  To Athens with her deep harbors, wealthy Kyzikos on the Propontis, mighty Halikarnassos where Mausolus reigned! Macedonians strong in battle, Aitolians reputed as pirates, and the people of Tenedos, famous for their wine. And they are bound by these ties to the people of sacred Delphi, where Apollo gives his oracles to all the world. 32 cities appear in one inscription alone: the town knows and loves its proxenoi!%(IG XII.9.1187)
network@Iolcus@Iolcus is my home! Or it is meant to be: my father Aeson is the rightful king, but my wicked uncle Pelias has stolen the throne: I may tell you, if you had many hours, of how I was raised by the wise centaur Chiron, hidden in the hills, how Athena herself crafted my ship, how Hera the queen of the gods is always on my side, how rumors of a golden fleece (!) have floated about our trip. @But let us be practical, young hero! As you set out on your journey, you know that you have never relied on the contracts among cities for your bravery on the sea or in battle: the people of Iolcus partake in no network, but do recognize the value of networks. You can select your crew, in part, for the friends they bring you!
network@Kerinthos@Does this town partake in network friendships?@A bald man has more use for a comb than does this town for friends abroad!
network@Larissa (Thessaly)@Is this town part of the networks that tie the world together?@Indeed! Both the network of the Samothracians, famous for the mysteries that preserve men on the sea, and the Aitolian league that stretches across the Aegean
network@Narthakion@Do the people of Narthakion cultivate friendships abroad?@Indeed they do! A single inscription names twenty seven cities among their friends: they are welcomed at Athens with her violet crown, Miletos the jewel of Asia, Magnesia on the Maeander, the river that rushes to the sea, Achaians in Aigion - this town celebrates its proxenoi!%(IG IX 2.90)
network@Opus@Do the people of Opus have friends abroad, networks that link them across the waves?@Not a one! They embrace independence, and count on other means to connect themselves to other Greeks. Five pillars are lined up in the neighborhood of Thermopylae, near its Polyandrion, where the noble dead are honored. 
network@Pagasae@Do the people of this town have network friends abroad?@No! They are as independent as they are ancient: long ago a Mycenaean port, and before that the neighbors of the towns more than ancient, Sesklo and Dimini, where Neolithic men built walls and fine ceramics, traded in goods that came across the sea, and stamped their possessions with signs of ownership.
network@Pelion@Will I find men here who claim formal friendships in other ports?@No, but you will find legends in abundance!
network@Pherae@Is Pherae a place for network connections?@Its travelers are as lonely as lost little chicks when they travel abroad! No welcoming ties are forged in advance: they must chat up every stranger as best they may!
network@Phthia@Do the people of Phthia have friends in foreign ports, or welcome travelers into their own networks?@You may remember the tale of Penelope, who unplucked every night the fabric she wove to fool the suitors who lurked in her halls. Nothing to unpluck in the web of Phthia! They travel without the safety net of friends established in advance.
network@Phylace@The people of Phylace, do they sustain the networks that tie the Greeks together, though separated by miles of sea?@They care less for networks like a barbarian cares for grammar!
network@Skiathos@I have heard of this tiny island, in a fortunate spot! Do they have network friends who recognize this value?@Skiathians care not for friendships abroad - tight friends in a tight space, their eyes are only on their fellow citizens.
network@Tisaia@Do the folk of Olizon care for network ties?@No more than a wolf cares for the feelings of a sheep!
network@ALLOTHERS@What are the network connections of this city?@{Grab network list - net_Ids from settlement_list spreadsheet connects to ids on available_networks spreadsheet}
