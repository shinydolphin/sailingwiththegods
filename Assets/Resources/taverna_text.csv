myth@Doris@Tell me of this place, Doris. @In the name of this city lies the Dorian race - those who think 'Doris' means 'woodland' or 'upland', appropriate for its mountain slopes! Dorians are the children of Herakles, who drove away the Dryopes from this site to claim it as their own: you may call them 'hunger Dorians', since they took such rich farmland! The soil is deep, the water abundant, springing from the Kephissos river; three mountain ranges protect her round about. Those Dryopes were brigands, pirates of the dry land: from there they ranged far and wide%.(Skylax 62)
myth@Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@This island has had many names! Some used to call it 'big' (Makris), others 'Long' (Doliche), - others Abantis, for the warrior tribes who lived here (Iliad 2.540-541, 'the raging Abantes who held Euboea and Chalcis and Eretria and Histiaia with its fine vineyards, and Kerinthos on the sea'.) Now we call it 'The land of the well-fed oxen', Euboea.
myth@Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@After rounding Sounion from Attike the island Euboea lies ahead, previously called, they say, Makris ('long') from its nature, next from the so-called Asopis, taking with time again the name Euboea. The first to inhabit it, they say, were mixed Lelegian settlers; Pandoros the son of Erechtheos crossed over from Attike to found Chalkis, the largest city on it, and Aiklos, an Athenian by race, founded Eretria, and likewise Kothos founded Kerinthos on the shore; Dryopes founded the city named Karystos, while Hestiaia was a foundation of the Perrhaibians. Islands lie near it, Skyros, Peparethos, Skiathos; the Cretans who crossed over from Knossos with Staphylos once settled Peparethos and Ikos, the island lying near it, while legend says Pelasgians crossed over from Thrace to settle Skyros and Skiathos. The Chalcidians resettled all of them after they became deserted.%(Geographi Graeci Minores 566)

myth@Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Poseidon is worshipped here ... and in the cities the Euboeans founded!

And in Aigai on Euboea, Poseidon has a shrine (Hesiod Fr. 149 MW; Diodorus Siculus 4.85; Strabo 9; Pausanias 9.20.3).
myth@Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@"Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Of him Hesiod wrote: ""Three other sons, Hekatoncheires were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and doughty beyond telling, Kottos and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children.

myth@Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Aelian cites Aristotle, saying that 'before the pillars of Herakles were so called they were known as the pillars of Briareos. But when Herakles purified both land and sea and became indisputably the benefactor of mankind, men honored him, named the pillars after Herakles and ceased to honor the memory of Briareos.'%(Historical Miscellany 5.3)
myth@Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Some think it has its name because Orion was raised here, that handsome giant and hunter! He followed in the company of Artemis on Crete (Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.3; Hyginus Poeticon Astronomicon 2.34); some say she loved him, and Apollo tricked her into shooting him as he swam in the sea. Or it may be that he loved her against her will, so she sent him a monster of a scorpion to kill him (Horace Carmina 2.4.72; Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.5). It lies at the foot of the mountain Telethrius, on the river Callas, on a high rock.%(Strabo 10.1.4)

Because of this the Athenians sent 2000 settlers to Histiaia's shores (Livy 28.6.2; 31.46.9). Later it was part of the Athenian league (Livy 28.5.18), then ruled by Macedon.

Theophrasuts wrote, 'There appears to be a kind of earth in some places, which when sprinkled over the seed helps to make wheat keep, for instance, the earth found at Olynthos and at Kerinthos in Euboea; this makes the grain inferior for food, but fuller in appearance; the earth is sprinkled in the proportion of one pint to twenty-four of grain.'%(<i>Enquiry into Plants</i> 8.11.6)
myth@Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@This is a small town (Strabo 10.446), near the banks of the river Budorus: Kothos of Athens was her founder, and she was sufficiently tied into the world of Greek cities to send ship to Ilium to fight against the Trojans!%(<i>Iliad</i> 2.538; Pliny, <i>Natural History</i> 4.12.21).

myth@Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Now some folks argue (and I think they are right) that the place comes from the name of its foundations, many in number and abundant in their waters (Strabo 9.5.15) Indeed it's famous for its hot springs!

Poets to come will sing of that fact: 'Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion floated through Neptune's clear waves, to the River Phasis and Aeetes' (Catullus 64.1). And it is great in size: Dicaearchus, a savant of the first rank, with the support of royal patrons took the measurement of mountains, and published that the highest of them was Pelion, with an altitude of 1250 paces (Pliny the Elder, Natural History 1-11, 2.65.1) I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Wise old Herodotus tells us the tale of the shipwreck of the Persian fleet - and the mountain's role in it!

myth@Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@It is the source of medicinal herbs: the type that thrive in cold regions, as centaury and wormwood, and further those that have medicinal properties in their roots and juices, such as hellebore, squirting cucumber, scammony, and nearly all those whose roots are gathered. Some which grow on Pelion are found as well in Pontus and Thrace, some about Oeta, Parnassus, Ossa and Telethrion, and in these parts some say that there is great abundance.%(Theophrastus, <i>Enquiry into Plants</i> 4.5.1-2) 
myth@Pelion@Worthy details, but are there not myths to share?@It is an infamous place, for infamous deeds of the immortals themselves! Otos and Ephialtes, whose names mean 'insatiate' and '˜nightmare', were the sons of Iphimede, wife of Aloeos, whom she bore to Poseidon. They were of extraordinary size - they each grew nine inches every month, and so when they were nine years old, they tried to climb into heaven. They began this way: they placed Mount Ossa on Pelion (from this Mount Ossa is also called Pelion), and were piling up other mountains. But they were discovered by Apollo and killed. ...When they wished to assault Artemis, she could not resist their strength, and Apollo sent a deer between them. Driven mad by anger in trying to kill it with javelins, they killed each other. In the Land of the Dead they are said to suffer this punishment: they are bound by serpents to a column, back to back. Between them is a screech-owl, sitting on the column to which they are bound'.%(Hyginus, <i>Fabulae</i> 28)

myth@Pelion@What can you tell me of the land of Pelion?@You must know that it is the land of centaurs - the race descended from Ixion, who assaulted Hera - or thought he did! It was a cloud he attacked, not the goddess herself, but the cloud bore him a child - a monstrous offspring - there was never a mother or a son like this - honored neither by men nor by the laws of the gods. She raised him and named him Centaurus, and he mated with the Magnesian mares in the foothills of Pelion, and from them was born a marvelous horde, which resembled both its parents: like the mother below, the father above. The gods accomplish everything according to their wishes.%(Pindar, <i>Pythian</i> 2.25)

myth@Pherae@Is the place known among the poets - have great deeds happened here?@This is the land of King Admetus, who's famous for shame rather than bravery!

myth@Phthia@What tales can you tell me of this place?@And here I dwell upon the boundaries of Phthia and Pharsalia's town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of Thessaly call it the Thetideion, in honour of the goddess's marriage.%(Euripides, <i>Andromache</i> 1 - ca. 425 BCE )

myth@Pieria@Tell me about this region.@Here in Pieria, the nine Muses were born. It is said that Zeus, the king of the gods, came to Mount Eleuther to lie with Mnemosyne, goddess of memory, for nine consecutive nights, conceiving their nine daughters.

They are as follows: Clio, Euterpe, Thaleia, Melpomene, Erato, Terpsichore, Polyhymnia, Urania, and Calliope.%(adapted from Hesiod, <i>Theogeny</i> 53,75)
myth@Pieria@What are the tales of this land?@Pieria takes its name from Pierus, the father of nine daughters. Those nine daughters had such great arrogance, it ultimately led them to their doom. They believed that since they matched the Muses, the goddesses who inspire art and poetry, in number, they could surely prevail over them, and the nine daughters challenged the nine muses to competitions in the arts. What fools they were! It is well known that mortals cannot challenge divinities without punishment! As a penalty for their audacity, the nine daughters of Pierus were condemned to spend the rest of eternity as magpies.%(adapted from Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i> 5.294ff)

myth@Zone@What can you tell me of this city?@In the city of Zone, there is a sanctuary to the goddess, Demeter, who presides over agriculture and harvesting. One day, Demeter's daughter by Lord Zeus, Persephone, was frolicking through fields, picking flowers, when she caught the eye of Hades, god of the Underworld. Hades flew by in his golden chariot, seizing the young girl, and taking her to the Underworld with him to be his bride. Demeter heard her beloved daughter's screams and instantly set out on a search for Persephone. For nine days she searched the earth with torches in hand, neither bathing, nor resting, nor eating nectar nor drinking ambrosia. On the tenth day, it was revealed to her that Persephone had been taken to the Underworld by Hades with the permission of Zeus. Demeter's sorrow only grew, and she went into hiding on Earth amongst the mortals. Her grief was so great, that for an entire year, mortals were not able to reap a harvest. Zeus then struck a deal with Hades, so Demeter's wrath might be eased. Persephone was to spend two thirds of the year with her mother, and the final part of the year ruling the Underworld with her husband Hades. During the parts of the year Persephone and Demeter are united, fields and harvests flourish with Demeter's joy. When Persephone descends back to Hades, Demeter mourns and the fields are barren. This is why we have seasons.%(adapted from Homer, <i>Hymn to Demeter</i>)
myth@Zone@What are the tales of this city?@Here in Zone, there is a temple to the god Apollo. Apollo, son of Zeus and Leto, twin brother of Artemis, the maiden goddess of the hunt, is an endlessly powerful god. He is charming, with flowing locks of gold.

Perhaps his greatest power is prophecy - sharing future happenings that have been willed by Zeus and fate itself. He presides over an oracle in Delphi, which mortals all across the world seek out for guidance.%(adapted from Homer, <i>Hymn to Apollo</i>)
myth@Zone@What is this city famed for?@Zone is a trading port colony of the island of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. This city is rich in iron, which became one of its main exports.

The name Ilium has been associated with windiness, sacred spaces, and steep hills. Some have speculated that Homer uses the names to denote different areas of the same city, but we may never know exactly. What you must remember is that Troy is always mythical, while Ilium is only sometimes mythical, and always real.%(Troy in <i>Brills New Pauly</i> July 2021)
myth@Ilium@What can you tell me about Ilium's impact? @Ilium is famed for its role in the Trojan Cycle. The war took place here many years ago, and Achilles died here. Troy's importance, however, remains its history. There are very few significant moments that took place here after Aeneas left to found Rome. 'Even Ilium, though it recalled Troy, the parent of Rome, held no significance except its glorious past.' As Tacitus tells us in the Annals, the only significant part of Ilium was its past.%(Tacitus, <i>Annals</i> 4.55)
myth@Alexandria Troas@What can you tell me about Alexandria Troas' past?@Founded in 306BC by one of Alexander the Great's army officers, Alexandria Troas was named after Alexander and converged the populations of at least six villages into one city. The site where Alexandria Troas was founded was once called Sigia. Though the city was named for Alexander, it was conquered by Antigonus I Monophthalmus and was initially named 'Antigoneia' after the officer himself. His surname means 'one eyed.'%(Billows, <i>Antigonos the One Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State</i> 1990; Briant, <i>Antigone le Borgne</i> 1973; Heckel, <i>The Marshals of Alexanders Empire</i> 1992; Wheatley, 'The Antigonid Campaign in Cyprus 306 BC' in <i>Ancient Society 31</i> 2001; 'Hegemon of Alexandreia Troas' in <i>Brills New Jacoby</i> July 2021)
myth@Alexandria Troas@Can you tell me about Alexandria Troas in the time of the Romans?@The Romans conquered Alexandria Troas during the Syrian War of 192-188BC. The Romans fought the Seleucids and the Aetolian Leauge in this war but were ultimately defeated. Alexandria Troas became free and autonomous in 188BC and became quite a wealthy province, thanks to its proximity to Troy, the motherland of Rome.%('Alexandria in Troas' on <i>Livius.org</i>)
myth@Alexandria Troas@Does anyone famous come from Alexandria Troas?@I thought you would never ask! Why yes! Alexandria Troas was home to Hegemon, the epic poet!  Hegemon was author of <i>The Leuktrian War of the Thebans and the Lakedaimonians</i>. Among other works, he was famous as a historian and poet!%('Hegemon of Alexandreia Troas', <i>Brills New Jacoby</i> July 2021)
myth@Methymna@What can you tell me of Methymna?@Methymna, famed for its wine (Sil. 7,211), was home of the poet Arion and the historian Myrsilus.%('Methymna', <i>Brills New Pauly</i> July 2021)
myth@Lesbos@What can you tell me of the history of Lesbos?@What a curious voyager! Lesbos is an island in the Northeastern Aegean and was named after the son of Lapithos, the descendant of Deucalion and Helen, further proving Ilium's influence on its neighbors. Lesbos was often caught between Greek and Persian rule, with periods of independence as well. Its ruling status often fell victim to its geographical position as an island on the edge of the Greek world.%('Lesbos' on <i>Pleiades.stoa.org</i>)
myth@Lesbos@What can you tell me of the myths of Lesbos?@Lesbos is featured in Homer's Iliad, when Agamemnon offers Achilles seven women, skilled in handicraft. 'And I will give seven women skilled in goodly handiwork, women of Lesbos, whom on the day when himself took well-built Lesbos I chose me from out the spoil.'%('Lesbos' on <i>Worldhistory.org</i>)
myth@Lesbos@What is Lesbos famous for?@Lesbos is not only famous for its women, skilled in handicrafts, but also for its wine, olive trees, and bucchero pottery. This pottery, unique for its beautiful gray and black coloring, was popularized by Etruscans from the 7th to 4th century BCE. Lesbos was also home to the famed lyric poet Sappho. Longus is also from Lesbos. You may recognize his work Daphnis and Chloe - a short pastoral tale of young love.%('Bucchero' on <i>Worldhistory.org</i>; 'Sappho', <i>Brills New Pauly</i> July 2021; 'Lesbos', <i>Brills New Pauly</i> July 2021)
myth@Lesbos@What can you tell me of the Lesbian myths?@The island became known as a safe haven for sailors. Tales of Leukothea were well known here! A goddess worshipped in all of Greece, connected with initiation and divine ritual. A fitting match for the initiation of a new settlement on the island! In those pirate ridden waters, safety at sea is valuable! In fact, the story of Lesbos's settlement tells of dolphins and Nereids - sea nymphs! According to Myrsilus of Methymna, Lesbos was first settled by an Aeolian named Enalus. Drowning in the Aeolian sea, Enalus was rescued by dolphins and sea nymphs and carried to the Lesbian shores, where he founded the many colonies on Lesbos. The settlement of this island, then, is undoubtedly linked with safety at sea and divine rescue.%('Leucothea', <i>Brills new Pauly</i> July 2021; Trapp and Jackson,  'Myrsilus of Methymna Hellenistic Paradoxographer' in <i>The Classical Review</i> 1995)
myth@Lesbos@What more can you tell me of the Lesbian myths?@Tales of Orpheus were well known on the island - Phanokles says that the head and lyre of Orpheus ended up on Lesbos, where locals buried them. The lyre was still singing! This led to the island's musical and poetic fame, and perhaps the lyric poet Sappho.%('Myrsilos of Methymna', <i>Brills New Jacoby</i> July 2021)
myth@Eresos@What can you tell me of Eresos?@Eresos is a village on Western coast of the island of Lesbos. Though it was the home town of the philosophers Theophrastus and Phaenias, and probably lyric poet Sappho, Eresos remains mysterious.%('Eresus', <i>Brills New Pauly</i> July 2021)
myth@ALLOTHERS@What tales can you tell me of this place?@{city description from settlement_list spreadsheet}
pirate@Alope@Do pirate ships prowl their sealanes?@Many of them, indeed! Illyrians and Aetolians alike find her docks ripe for plucking.
pirate@Anthedon@Will I keep my eye on the horizon for pirate vessels if I choose to trek to Anthedon?@Illyrians and Aitolians alike may prey on you in Anthedon's port.
pirate@Doris@Will I keep my eye on the horizon for pirate vessels if I choose to trek to Anthedon?@You will if you wish to live! Scoundrelly Illyrians who take pride in their piracy, Aetolians famous in war, and the Etruscans who swoop in from western shores, will all be keeping an eye out for travelers like you.
pirate@Euboea@Must my crew keep arms at the ready as we cruise along its banks?@You will if you hope to survive! Many pirates know its coves: Illyrians who follow Queen Teuta, Cretan dogs, the rascally grandsons of Minos, and Aetolians who'll sack a sanctuary to pluck out a gold statue or two!
pirate@Histiaia/Oreos@Do the people of Histiaia have reason to fear when they put to sea - do pirates lurk along their coasts?@Alas indeed! They tremble for the Aetolian pirates, as well as Illyrian: both types as greedy as they are fearless! Homer sang of this ferocity: 'Even as a leopard goes forth from a deep thicket in full view of a hunter and he is not afraid, He does not flee when he hears the baying of the hounds.'%(<i>Iliad</i> 21.568-570)
pirate@Iolcus@What of pirates in my homeland?@Indeed! Iolcus is beset by Illyrians and Aetolians alike: Ferocious pirates, they will be the end of you! The eels and the fishes will finish you off, dining on the fat from your kidneys while the dark water laps about you.%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.201-205)
pirate@Kerinthos@Will pirates lurk around the bend as we draw close to this town?@Illyrians, Cretans and Aetolians alike hover to challenge you, and grow rich from your stores! They will fall upon you and you will strive to escape: as when, beneath the surge of a fire, locusts take wing to flee to a river as the relentless fire sears them with its sudden oncoming, and they shrink down beneath the water.%(<i>Iliad</i> 21.12-15)
pirate@Kerinthos@Will pirates lurk around the bend as we draw close to this town?@Indeed - Cretans famous for lying, Aetolians famous for bravery, and Illyrians, famous for love of piratical craft! You will cower before them 'as when fish flee before a voracious dolphin and fill the crannies of a harbor with good anchorage in their terror, for the dolphin greedily devours every one he can'!%(<i>Iliad</i> 21.23-25)
pirate@Larissa (Thessaly)@Do pirates pester so well-connected a town?@Only the Aitiolians: some claim that the Larissan's formal friendship with Aitolia was driven by the desire to buy themselves freedom from predation!
pirate@Narthakion@Do pirates pester this place?@Illyrian scoundrels and Aetolian freebooters, the worst of the worst! 
pirate@Opus@Pirates?@Probably!
pirate@Pagasae@Must I fear pirates in these waters, and keep an eye on my crew, my stores, my life?@Only if you are wise! The port from which you first set sail is on the itinerary as well for pirates from Aetolia and Illyria: how unfortunate it never chose to become the friends of the Aetolians!  Such pirates are mighty in battle: they will cast you to the fishes, to lick the blood from your wounds! Nor will your mothers get to mourn you, but your remains will dance along the surface of the broad breast of the sea - many a fish, leaping amid the waves, will dart up from the black ruffling water to eat your white fat.%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.124-130)
pirate@Pelion@Do pirates lurk in this region?@Indeed, even in the shadow of the mountain of centaurs! It seems the memory of the centaurs infuses the people who sail its coasts: pirates of Crete and Aetolia, Illyrians as well, come close by, sniffing the air for a ready catch! 'Their bronze swords will loosen your knees and undo your strong heart, Your dark blood will flow from your neck and wet the ground'!%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.116-121)
pirate@Pherae@Must I keep an eye on my back, watching for pirates off its shores?@You have heard of the Illyrians, followers of a queen who puts Amazons to shame, the Aetolians who fear no man and love all gain - they will embrace you at your coming, undo the strings of your purse, and leave your men shaking in their rowing benches! Prepare for a fight if you draw into those waters!
pirate@Phthia@Pirates?@Probably!
pirate@Phylace@Pirates?@Probably!
pirate@Skiathos@Do pirates know the island, and its bays? Must I keep an eagle eye out for what I say in the taverns there, lest they overhear my plans?@They know it, and compete with each other to pluck the unwary, like fish from the fisherman's nets! The Illyrians, grandsons of Snake-like Kadmos and Harmonia, whom he plucked from Samothrace's festivals, will haunt your trails; Cretans, who can credit great Minos for their habit of lying, will vie to outdo them. And Aetolians, who never fear a fight, may outdo those two in boarding your ship and seizing your wares.
pirate@Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight! Their bronze swords will loosen your knees and undo your strong heart, your dark blood will flow from your neck and wet the ground.%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.116-121)
pirate@Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight! They are masters of war: wild madness seizes their hearts, and they long to capture glory!%(adapted from <i>Iliad</i> 21.540)
pirate@Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight! They will over take you, and you will sink like stones into 'the deep of the gray sea that holds back many against their will'!%(<i>Iliad</i> 21.60-61)
pirate@Pieria@What kinds of pirates are known for lurking in these waters?@Pieria lies on the western-most reach of the Aetolian pirates' span. If you find your way to the seaport of Pydna on the coast of Pieria, you will most certainly meet those Aetolian scoundrels.

pirate@Dardanos@Are there pirates in this area who might plunder my ship if given the chance?@"Yes, the Aetolians pose a significant threat to not only your ship and your cargo, but also to the lives of you and your men. Dio warns of them, saying, ""???? But with the Aetolians no truce was made, for they would not submit to any curtailment of privileges."" Heed this warning and flee, rather than hope to strike a deal!% (<i>Dio Cassius, Histories 19.19.8</i>)"
pirate@Lampsakos@What dangers face me as I sail off? Are there pirates nearby?@"Yes, the Aetolians are a danger to all who sail here. A man named Thoas in particular is the most fearful of all Aetolians, and is said to be ""well-skilled in throwing the javelin, but a good man too in close fight.""

pirate@Parium@What ought I to know before I sail away from here?@"Pirates stalk these waters! The Aetolians in particular ravage this coast.

pirate@Sestos@Should I fear for my safety and that of my men as we sail off?@Yes, the pirates pose a grave threat to the lives of all who sail here, especially the Aetolians.

network@Anthedon@Friendly or insular, open or closed, what will I encounter as the networks of this town?@They are in the network of Aetolians. They extend from one end of the world to the other! Kyzikos rich in gold staters, Syracuse with her green fields and fine temples, the islands of Crete and Sicily, Thracians skilled in trade and iron, and the Phoenicians of noble Sidon... all the way into the Black Sea.
network@Doris@Will the city care for the networks that hold bind cities together?@Not a whit! They neither give proxenia, nor honor the bonds of other cities. 
network@Euboea@Are Euboeans skilled at weaving the bonds that tie the world together?@Not at all! No networks claim them as their friends.
network@Histiaia/Oreos@How networked to friends across the sea are the people of Histiaia?@Clever and foresightful are the people of this town! They are among the network of the Aitolians, masters of weaving connections from Sidon to the far west, as well as the people of Epidauros of Argos. Folks would flock to Epidauros to be healed by Asclepius himself - it is a sanctuary worth seeing! And the town had ties across the Peloponnese.
network@Histiaia/Oreos@How networked to friends across the sea are the people of Histiaia?@The proxenoi of this city stretch from one side of the sea to another!  To Athens with her deep harbors, wealthy Kyzikos on the Propontis, mighty Halikarnassos where Mausolus reigned! Macedonians strong in battle, Aitolians reputed as pirates, and the people of Tenedos, famous for their wine. And they are bound by these ties to the people of sacred Delphi, where Apollo gives his oracles to all the world. 32 cities appear in one inscription alone: the town knows and loves its proxenoi!%(IG XII.9.1187)

Or it is meant to be: my father Aeson is the rightful king, but my wicked uncle Pelias has stolen the throne: I may tell you, if you had many hours, of how I was raised by the wise centaur Chiron, hidden in the hills, how Athena herself crafted my ship, how Hera the queen of the gods is always on my side, how rumors of a golden fleece (!) have floated about our trip. @But let us be practical, young hero! As you set out on your journey, you know that you have never relied on the contracts among cities for your bravery on the sea or in battle: the people of Iolcus partake in no network, but do recognize the value of networks.

network@Narthakion@Do the people of Narthakion cultivate friendships abroad?@Indeed they do! A single inscription names twenty seven cities among their friends: they are welcomed at Athens with her violet crown, Miletos the jewel of Asia, Magnesia on the Maeander, the river that rushes to the sea, Achaians in Aigion - this town celebrates its proxenoi!%(IG IX 2.90)
network@Opus@Do the people of Opus have friends abroad, networks that link them across the waves?@Not a one! They embrace independence, and count on other means to connect themselves to other Greeks. Five pillars are lined up in the neighborhood of Thermopylae, near its Polyandrion, where the noble dead are honored. 
network@Pagasae@Do the people of this town have network friends abroad?@No! They are as independent as they are ancient: long ago a Mycenaean port, and before that the neighbors of the towns more than ancient, Sesklo and Dimini, where Neolithic men built walls and fine ceramics, traded in goods that came across the sea, and stamped their possessions with signs of ownership.
network@Pelion@Will I find men here who claim formal friendships in other ports?@No, but you will find legends in abundance!
network@Pherae@Is Pherae a place for network connections?@Its travelers are as lonely as lost little chicks when they travel abroad! No welcoming ties are forged in advance: they must chat up every stranger as best they may!
network@Phthia@Do the people of Phthia have friends in foreign ports, or welcome travelers into their own networks?@You may remember the tale of Penelope, who unplucked every night the fabric she wove to fool the suitors who lurked in her halls. Nothing to unpluck in the web of Phthia! They travel without the safety net of friends established in advance.
