Similar emblems appear on the coins of Epidaurus. These coins are taken as evidence for a cult of Asklepios in Amorgos, either as a healing center or identified with a local physician-hero. Two inscriptions from the island honor doctors for their gifts to the gods, suggesting that the healing arts were held in high regard here.

The lyre is the instrument of the god Apollo, who was said to be born on the island along with his sister Artemis: in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo,  Leto begs the island to let her give birth there, as no other place on earth would risk Hera’s anger at the woman her husband had loved.  Leto points out that the island has few resources in terms of land, but that the cult of Apollo would compensate, making it a gathering place for feasts and festivals. Delos, if you would be willing to be the abode of my son Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich temple –; for no other will touch you, as you will find: and I think you will never be rich in oxen and sheep, nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you have the temple of far-shooting Apollo, all men will bring you hecatombs and gather here, and incessant savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will feed those who dwell in you from the hand of strangers; for truly your own soil is not rich.

The suckling calf is an image of fertility familiar from Euboea; the meaning of the floral pattern is debated. Romantic 19th century scholars called it the Gardens of Alkinoos, recalling Homer’s Odyssey and the king who helped welcome Odysseus back to his home on the western edge of Greece. Others have suggested it evokes the twin stars of the Dioscuri, the sons of Zeus who aided travelers and were models of fraternal affection.

The city is positioned on a small peninsula on the coastal road between Istros and Byzantium; it benefited from its proximity to the Danube delta. Memnon calls it an emporium (FHG 3, 557). Strabo noted that the hinterland was full of Scordisci, Crobyzi and Troglodytae (Strabo 7.5.12).
