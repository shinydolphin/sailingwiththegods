You are a pretty bunch of sailors! Your shoes are too big, you talk too loud: you pathetic bumpkins, you show wonder at nothing of note, but stand and gape at an ox or an ass or a goat in the streets. You drink strong wine, you eat breakfast while feeding your pigs, you sing at the bath, you drive nails into your shoes!%(adapted from Theophrastus 4, The Boor)@greeting@unhappy
I recognize what kind of men you are, shameless to the core! You're the kind who borrow from the creditors whose money you are witholding; when you sacrifice to the gods, you put away the salted remains and then dine out; you give bread and meat from the table of the gods to your attendant, telling him 'Feast, most worshipful!'.^In the market, you cheat the butcher, throwing extra meat on the scales after he's weighed it; you take places at the theater for your foreign visitors and then don't pay for your share, your sons, or your attendants. And you never pay for a bath!%(adapted from Theophrastus 9, The Shameless Man)@greeting@unhappy
I can see you a mile away - you're the financial dregs of the earth! You are the kind who borrows half an obol at mid-month, who counts how many cups everyone drinks, who subtracts from the rations of your slaves the cost of vessels they break; you'll rip the house to pieces looking for a lost copper coin.^You don't lend salt, a lamp wick, cumin, or garlands, not even to your kinsmen; your money box is moldy and its key has turned to rust. And you always get your hair cut too short, just to avoid the next trip to the barber!%(adapted from Theophrastus 10, The Penurious Man)@greeting@unhappy
Unwelcome you are, the lot of you - stupidest of men! You're the kind who do a sum and then ask the person standing next to you, 'what's the total?' You fall asleep in the theater; you go on vacation when you're being sued; if anyone loans you something, you lose it; you blame your servants for not buying cucumbers in mid-winter; you over-salt the leeks; you think rain makes the sky smell good (not the earth!).%(adapted from Theophrastus 14, The Stupid Man)@greeting@unhappy
Violet crowned, city of philosophers, her wine renowned through the Mediterranean - this place rivals Olympus in excellence!@greeting@happy
The men of this place sprang from the soil itself, proud autochthones, natural rulers of men!@greeting@happy
This city is the work of one of the gods, and sacred to them all; as if it had been set aside and allotted among all the gods, it has now been parceled out, and the temples have divided it up, as if the gods were competing against one another on behalf of the safety of the city. There are sacrifices, parades, processions, and divine services under established codes.%(Aelius Aristides, <i>Orationes</i> 27.14)@greeting@happy
The temple of this city is equal to the mountains, and you alone have no need for beacons, signal fires, and towers for those putting into port. But the temple fills every vista, and at the same time reveals the city and the magnanimity of its inhabitants. And although it is so great, its beauty exceeds its size.%(Aelius Aristides, <i>Orationes</i> 27.17)@greeting@happy
You new arrivals, imagine the peril of the gods you have offended en route! Dangers lurk at every corner until you appease them! Quickly, quickly...@greeting@nervous
You must wash your hands at the sacred fountain, sprinkle yourself from the temple font, put some laurel leaf in your mouth, and keep it there all day! Sprinkle yourself with seawater! Carry a puppy around yourself three times! Purity is everything!@greeting@nervous
"Terrible, frightening, horrifying things may happen as you head into town! A weasel may run across your path: don't take another step until you throw three stones across the path! Or you may see a serpent: by all the gods, invoke Sabazius and build him a shrine!%Or - most awesome - you may hear an owl screech. That's the sign for you to exclaim ""Glory be to Athena!"" and you will surely come across smooth stones, set in the earth at the crossroads: then you must pour out pure oil from your flasks, fall on your knees and worship them.%(adapted from Theophrastus 16, The Superstitious Man)"@greeting@nervous
Are you a merchant, a warrior, a pirate or just a thief? I know what pirates look like! I sailed with them, forced to pull an oar and wield a sword.... Kidnapped from my home by them, when I was just a lad!  So I know what kinds of scum you may be - and this city's no friend if that's who you are!@greeting@distrustful
Greedy as merchants, dishonest as thieves, viscious as soldiers - you look like pirates to me! This isn't your kind of city: pirates come through here every year, snatching our citizens and holding them for ransom. We curse them every year, consigning to Hades any who receives a brigand as a friend or plunders our good citizens.@greeting@distrustful
Are you pirates? Obnoxious adolescents of the deep blue sea? You are famously irritating! We have heard of the odious extravagance of your equipment, your gilded sails, purple awnings, and silvered oars: you riot in your iniquity and plume yourselves upon it.^Your flutes and stringed instruments and drinking bouts along every coast, your seizures of persons in high command, your ransomings of captured cities: these are more annoying than fearsome, and a disgrace to ordered life.%(adapted from Plutarch, <i>Pompey</i>)@greeting@distrustful
Are you pirates? Then you are brave, bold and ambitious: the model of men! Plutarch wrote: men whose wealth gave them power, and those whose lineage was illustrious, and those who laid claim to superior intelligence, began to embark on piratical craft and share their enterprises, feeling that the occupation brought them a certain reputation and distinction.%(<i>Life of Pompey</i> 24) @greeting@distrustful
Are you pirates? Our merchants will welcome you, and our princes invite you to dine! Cassius Dio wrote of you: 'they showed such friendship one for another as to send money and assistance even to those entirely unknown, as if to their nearest of kin. In fact, this was one of the chief sources of their strength, that those who paid court to any of them were honored by all, and those who came into collision with any of them were despoiled by all.'%(36.22)@greeting@distrustful
Are you pirates? You are as welcome as a king! For when Alexander the Great had captured a pirate, and asked him what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride: 'What you mean by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, while you who does it with a great fleet are styled emperor.'%(St. Augustine, <i>The City of God</i> 4.4)@greeting@distrustful
Are you pirates? Enter, you are welcome, the city is yours! Cicero himself writes: 'the importance of justice is so great that not even those who engage in crime for a livelihood can survive without some canons of justice among themselves. If a pirate chief failed to distribute booty equitably among his crew, he would be abandoned or even killed by his comrades. Thence the rule 'honor among thieves', which they are all obliged to observe.'%('On Duties' 2.40)@greeting@distrustful
By the gods, what kinds of fools men are who go to sea! You are either brave or stupid - likely both! Hesiod, the great poet of Boiotia, was right when he sang, 'If ever you turn your misguided heart to trading and wish to escape from debt and joyless hunger, I will show you the measures of the loud-roaring sea, though I have no skill in sea-faring nor in ships; for never yet have I sailed by ship over the wide sea.'%(<i>Works and Days</i> 648-50)@greeting@shocked
You are in from the sea - a most welcomed conclusion! Even the knees of great Odysseus himself were loosened, and his heart melted, when he transitioned from sea to shore: he heard the boom of the sea against the reefs, the great wave thundering against the dry land, belching upon it in a terrible fashion, and all things wrapped up in the foam of the sea.%(adapted from Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> 5.400-407)@greeting@shocked
Your journey is over - I would not take one for all the world! A journey at sea is a war with the elements. When a man is at sea, the great billows of the broad waves sweep down over the bulwarks, driven on  by the might of the wind, which more than anything else makes the wave swell; the water moves across the deck like Trojans rushing over their city wall.%(adapted from Homer, <i>Iliad</i> 15.381-4)@greeting@shocked
Back from the sea - where even gods are not safe! Was it not on a ship that Dionysos himself, a handsome youth, was kidnapped by hapless Tyrrhenian pirates?  He turned the ship into a vineyard and the pirates into dolphins, but now he tames all water by mixing it with wine: even the god shuns the wine-dark sea!@greeting@shocked
Nothing is worse than the sea, I always say, to crush a man, the strongest man alive!%(Laodamas, Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> 16.195)@greeting@shocked
The sea is a beast, it can eat a man! A great gullet, it swallowed Odysseus whole, belched him up on the shore; boundless, it teems with monsters, and is implacable: it is barren and terrible, loud-roaring and full of storms. Odysseus himself, the most famous traveler, recalled that his crew was 'driven by all sorts of winds over the great chasm of the sea, wishing for home, and we went on this road and then that' (<i>Odyssey</i> 9.260): no man goes happily to the sea!@greeting@shocked
All fear the onset of a voyage, all rejoice at its conclusion! The Siren voice alone can silence the sudden gusts of the west wind, and when the north wind, shivering with the force of winter, rages and frets with its blasts the swift waves of the sea.%(adapted from Pindar, Fr. 84)@greeting@shocked
I myself have great sums of money at sea! A vast money-lending empire, with epic gains and losses; I served with Alexander the Great, his dearest and closest companion, and from our adventures brought home more than thirty gemmed cups, made by Asiatic artists, so superior to these European types!^I gave as a free gift more than five talents to the distressed citizens of my beloved town, the last time we were struck by famine. Fortunate you are indeed, to have met me first of all!%(adapted from Theophrastus 23, The Boastful Man)@greeting@bragging
Grant me gracious respect both amongst citizens and foreigners, since I walk a straight path that spurns hubris, having learned clearly what the upright minds of my noble ancestors have decreed for me!%(adapted from Pindar, Olympian 7.87-92)@greeting@bragging
The feast of Olympia Herakles established, the loot of war, but me you shall praise for courtesy and goodness to guests, the bulwark of this town: I am the flower of a famous father, and on my merits this city stands.%(adapted from Pindar, Olympian 2)@greeting@bragging
The man driven in his spirit%By unworthy ambition%May win honor in his lifetime.%But the race for excellence is hard,%And when properly pursued it%Alone leaves an enviable monument for a man%Even after he dies: such is the fame my father and his house!%(adapted from Bacchylides, Ode 1 178-184)@greeting@bragging
What is better for a man, than to be loved by the gods and win his share of blessings of all sorts? Such is the reputation of my family, who guide this town with a firm hand!%(adapted from Bacchylides, Ode 4 19-20)@greeting@bragging
Hesiod declared 'whom the immortals honor, fame among men attends as well.' Fortunate indeed is your ship full of men, met by a man of good family.^We are honored by the gift of the Graces, and in prophecy, strong with golden hope; our hearts swell over the ploughed lands and herds of cattle that make us preeminent in the city. Best it is for a noble man to be much-envied among men; wealth has great power, it makes the useless useful.%(adapted from Bacchylides Odes 5 and 10)@greeting@bragging
Poseidon the earth shaker has smiled upon you! He did not wreck your ship, nor did the sea envelop your sailors, nor did Zeus the king of the deathless gods seek to slay you.@greeting@happy
You are most welcome: here xenia reigns, the kindness to strangers that binds our world together. You can expect warm welcome, hot baths, generous feasts and the forging of new friendships: men of this town behave as wisely as Odysseus, as bravely as Achilles, and as divinely as Hermes himself.@greeting@happy
You must be the wisest of men! You know to admire a small ship, but put your freight in a. large one: for the greater the lading, the greater your piled gain, so long as the winds keep back their harmful gales: thus spake Hesiod!%(Works and Days 647-48)@greeting@happy
Greetings welcomed traveler, so much news to be shared, so much gossip, so very much all about me! Shall I tell you what I dreamed last night, or perhaps what I had for dinner, or how beautiful my wife is? You know it's just so true, the men of today are to those of antiquity like fleas are to the dog on which they reside: the times are so diminished!^And speaking of diminished, our town is full of foreigners, strange tongues, odd costumes, and new rites: have a care you don't fall into the  wrong company! But I get ahead of myself, you are safe now, largely because of course the sea is always safer after the Dionysia.^But speaking of gods, wouldn't it be far more just if Zeus, most just of gods, would do us the mercy of sending more rain? The crops would flourish and the price of wheat will go down, but you'll learn enough about that when you get to the agora.^Now as for me, though, what to plant for next year, and what to hope for, well that's the kind of thing that makes us turn to the Mysteries. Did I mention that my kinsman Damippus set up a very large torch at the Mysteries? Do go see! And as for Mysteries, the city's calendar is as full of those as Hermes is full of tricks! We'll have the Great Mysteries in the month of Boedromion, the Apaturia in Pyanepsion, the rural Dionysia in Poseideon.%(adapted from Theophrastus III, The Garrulous Man)@greeting@happy
My dear fellow! Give me both your hands, come alongside me, when will you dine with me, when will you come? Tell me this minute all about your adorable children, they must look as much like you as one fig looks like another! A thousand compliments to you and your crew!%(adapted from Theophrastus 5, The Complaisant Man)@greeting@happy
Where are you from, and what are your tidings? What news have you to give me? Anything fresh in the rumor mill? Certainly you have some glorious tidings! What say you?^You have heard nothing? I flatter myself that I can treat you to some news....about a handsome soldier, or an exceptionally tricky slave of Asteius the fluteplayer, or Lycon the contractor, always up to no good, but most recently arrived from the field of battle, from whom he says that he has heard of SO many new bits of news....%(adapted from Theophrastus 8, The Gossip)@greeting@happy

I'm the slave and servant of the port tax collector - but don't assume you can wangle your way out of the dues you much pay! A servant needs a powerful mind, stronger than his master's - he must know how to do both good and evil.^And so I am a rascal with the rascally, a robber of robbers, a cheater of cheats. In me you see the skill perfected of seeming virtuous to a good man, corrupted to the bad, and adapting my soul to whatever situation arises. And I am your introduction to this place!%(adapted from Bacchides 651-60)@greeting@flattering
Welcome most welcome of travelers! Do you see how people are looking at you, even as you just set foot in our port? A compliment was paid to you yesterday at the Stoa. More than thirty persons were sitting there: the question was started, Who is our foremost man? Everyone mentioned you first, and ended by coming back to your name. Oh wait, let me brush that bit of chaff off your coat - such a handsome sailor you are!@greeting@flattering
Honored guest, you fine your appearance, how noble your features! Surely you've descended from Olympus, or risen from the halls of Poseidon himself@greeting@flattering
Nets are for fishermen, networks for friends: who in this fishy harbor can tell me of your city's ties abroad? Tell me, friend, of your far-flung ties!@jasonnetworkquestion@neutral
Glaukos and Diomedes, friends so firm they exchanged their armor - that is the kind of network friendship I seek! Tell me, port master, are there men of such honor here, and to what cities are they tied?@jasonnetworkquestion@neutral
Speak to me of the web that ties you to kinsmen and allies abroad! Is it slender as a spider's, or as strong as Athena's, woven on an Olympian loom? Into which other cities is your fortune woven?@jasonnetworkquestion@neutral
Do the gods of your city smile on the stranger, and its citizens look out for their wellbeing? Tell me where your citizens are welcome when they travel, and whose citizens you welcome here!@jasonnetworkquestion@neutral
Do your citizens show the friendship that bound hero to hero, and prince to prince, in the days of old? Or is yours a web like Circe, designed for destruction? Tell me of your network!@jasonnetworkquestion@neutral
Our city's network makes Zeus look like a hermit! Our citizens live their lives performing services to those who come to meet them on business, public or private.@networkhigh@neutral
Alexander the great had no fewer friends abroad than we, nor do our citizens fail to welcome travelers with the charm of Alkinoos, the wisdom of Arete, and feasts remembered in song.@networkhigh@neutral
As ants toil without pause, as rivers wear down mountains, so have our citizens built up honors abroad and reputation here! We are among the most networked of places around the great sea!@networkhigh@neutral
As a shepherd with his flocks, or a merchant with one ship, we have a network sufficient for our needs, but insufficient for praise.@networkmid@neutral
Our fathers were known abroad, our grandfathers not: as the apple to the tree is the size of our network.@networkmid@neutral

Our network has strengths, though they may be few! The wise sage Pittacus would remind you, 'Know thine opportunity!'@jasonnetworkmid@neutral
We have some success, some failures, when it comes to connectivity: we are not the least connected, in all the wide world. Remember what Pittacus of Mytilene would tell you: 'Cultivate truth, good faith, experience, cleverness, sociability and industry!'@jasonnetworkmid@neutral
As Pittacus of Mytilene said, 'Even the gods cannot strive against Necessity' - and so has our life been! A middling fine network sails with our ship: be wise, and consider Chilon of Sparta, who said 'you should not desire the impossible.' You may make some fine deals with our crew!@jasonnetworkmid@neutral

We need to pay our citizens to keep the democracy running! We pay our jurors, our magistrates, any who attend the assembly: we call it misthos, you call it cash!@taxesintro@neutral
We need to be on a wartime footing, and triremes are not cheap!  We must have a fleet of ships as strong as eagles, as fast as deer, as deadly as lions - and that makes them as expensive as all the gold counting houses of Croesus. Spartan Archidamos knew this when he said, 'War is not a matter of weapons, but of money which gives weapons their usefulness'%(Thucy 1.83.2-3) @taxesintro@neutral
With a great fleet, such as our city wishes, comes a great host of men to pull the oars, raise the sails, repair the ships and build the sheds that will hold them. 200 men are needed for each and every ship - they must be paid, and our tax payers pay them!@taxesintro@neutral
We are a seafaring people, and that means we need ships: if you need a reminder how expensive they are, just contemplate the names of the ships in our docks! One we call 'Glutton', another 'Needy'; that one over there we call 'Greedy', to its right is 'Omnivorous'; to your left you see 'Piggy' 'Munchies' and 'Unsatisfied'. Aristophanes said it best: 'In war those at whose side wealth sits will always prevail.'%(Plout. 184-5)@taxesintro@neutral
Stenochoria is the little goddess of our docks: her name means 'financial strain' and embodies our state. We are feeling a bit poorly, which is to say, poor: our roads need repair, our temple roofs are sagging, the columns in our stoa need some fresh touching up with bright colored paint: a good city needs a good budget. These are the reasons our citizens dig deep into their pockets: you should dig just as deep into yours, if you seek to build clout as well as profit!@taxesintro@neutral
The city needs money, because the city needs festivals! Who will pay for the choruses, the playwrights, the sacrifices and feasts, the processions, the performances, the cleanup when we're done? Our wealthiest citizens give generously: you too, stranger, can be an ornament to our city... Or at any rate, your pocketbook can!@taxesintro@neutral

A city this seems, of settled men - not the wandering tribes of Scythia, Abioi, milk-eaters, riders in wagons.@jasonwhere@neutral
We can see buildings and walls, an agora, a temple! Clearly we are not in some primitive place, where humans live on acorns and berries, do not know the craft of wine, and cannot plow a field.@jasonwhere@neutral

You have sworn an oath to respect this privilege - as all citizens do!
