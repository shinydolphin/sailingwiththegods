Current Team:

Dr. Sandra Blakely – Project Director, Emory University, Department of Classics

Sandra Blakely is an Associate Professor of Classics at Emory University, where her research integrates anthropological, archaeological and Classical approaches to Greek religion and myth.  Her foci include mystery cults, the fragmentary Greek historians Herodoros, Conon and Alexander Polyhistor, and the daimones associated with metallurgy as well as with the Samothracian rites.  In her current book project, The Anthropology of an Island Cult: Maritime Networks and the cult of the Great Gods of Samothrace, she brings Social Network Analysis and Geographic Information Systems to the epigraphic record of the Great Gods of Samothrace, to test the hypothesis that the safety at sea the Samothracian rites promised was a social reality as well as a mythic metaphor.
