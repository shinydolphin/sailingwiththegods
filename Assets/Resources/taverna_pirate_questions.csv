Doris@Will I keep my eye on the horizon for pirate vessels if I choose to trek to Anthedon?@You will if you wish to live!

Euboia@Must my crew keep arms at the ready as we cruise along its banks?@You will if you hope to survive! Many pirates know its coves: Illyrians who follow Queen Teuta, Cretan dogs, the rascally grandsons of Minos, and Aetolians who'll sack a sanctuary to pluck out a gold statue or two!
Histiaia/Oreos@Do the people of Histiaia have reason to fear when they put to sea - do pirates lurk along their coasts?@Alas indeed! They tremble for the Aetolian pirates, as well as Illyrian: both types as greedy as they are fearless!

Iolcus@What of pirates in my homeland?@Indeed! Iolcus is beset by Illyrians and Aetolians alike: Ferocious pirates, they will be the end of you! The eels and the fishes will finish you off, dining on the fat from your kidneys while the dark water laps about you.%(adapted from Iliad 21: 201-205)
Kerinthos@Will pirates lurk around the bend as we draw close to this town?@Illyrians, Cretans and Aetolians alike hover to challenge you, and grow rich from your stores!

Kerinthos@Will pirates lurk around the bend as we draw close to this town?@Indeed - Cretans famous for lying, Aetolians famous for bravery, and Illyrians, famous for love of piratical craft!

Larissa (Thessaly)@Do pirates pester so well-connected a town?@Only the Aitiolians: some claim that the Larissan's formal friendship with Aitolia was driven by the desire to buy themselves freedom from predation!
Narthakion@Do pirates pester this place?@Illyrian scoundrels and Aetolian freebooters, the worst of the worst! 
Opus@Pirates?@Probably!
Pagasae@Must I fear pirates in these waters, and keep an eye on my crew, my stores, my life?@Only if you are wise! The port from which you first set sail is on the itinerary as well for pirates from Aetolia and Illyria: how unfortunate it never chose to become the friends of the Aetolians!  Such pirates are mighty in battle: they will cast you to the fishes, to lick the blood from your wounds! Nor will your mothers get to mourn you, but your remains will dance along the surface of the broad breast of the sea - many a fish, leaping amid the waves, will dart up from the black ruffling water to eat your white fat.%(adapted from Iliad 21: 124-130)
Pelion@Do pirates lurk in this region?@Indeed, even in the shadow of the mountain of centaurs!

'Their bronze swords will loosen your knees and undo your strong heart, Your dark blood will flow from your neck and wet the ground'!%(adapted from Iliad 21: 116-121)
Pherae@Must I keep an eye on my back, watching for pirates off its shores?@You have heard of the Illyrians, followers of a queen who puts Amazons to shame, the Aetolians who fear no man and love all gain - they will embrace you at your coming, undo the strings of your purse, and leave your men shaking in their rowing benches! Prepare for a fight if you draw into those waters!
Phthia@Pirates?@Probably!
Phylace@Pirates?@Probably!
Skiathos@Do pirates know the island, and its bays? Must I keep an eagle eye out for what I say in the taverns there, lest they overhear my plans?@They know it, and compete with each other to pluck the unwary, like fish from the fisherman's nets! The Illyrians, grandsons of Snake-like Kadmos and Harmonia, whom he plucked from Samothrace's festivals, will haunt your trails; Cretans, who can credit great Minos for their habit of lying, will vie to outdo them. And Aetolians, who never fear a fight, may outdo those two in boarding your ship and seizing your wares.
Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight!

Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight! They are masters of war: wild madness seizes their hearts, and they long to capture glory!%(adapted from Iliad 21: 540)
Tisaia@Will we fear pirates as we round the corner, departing the gulf of Pagasae?@Illyrians and Aetolians are not your friends here - as likely to rob you as to demand a fight!
